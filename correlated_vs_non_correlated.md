* **Most queries** can be written **both ways** (correlated and non-correlated).
* But sometimes **one form is more natural / readable**, and sometimes **one form isn’t possible without extra schema design (like a join table)**.

---

## When both are possible

Example:
“Orders higher than the average order total for the same customer.”

* **Correlated** (your version):

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.customer_id, o.total
FROM orders o
WHERE o.total > (
    SELECT AVG(o2.total) 
    FROM orders o2 
    WHERE o2.customer_id = o.customer_id
);
```

* **Non-correlated** (rewrite with GROUP BY + HAVING or join):

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.customer_id, o.total
FROM orders o
JOIN (
    SELECT customer_id, AVG(total) AS avg_total
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
) t ON o.customer_id = t.customer_id
WHERE o.total > t.avg_total;
```

👉 Both give the same result.

* Correlated = conceptually simpler (“for this row, compare to avg”).
* Non-correlated = often faster because it computes averages just once.

## ✅ When correlated is **more natural / needed**

Sometimes you want to check **existence** of a related row quickly, e.g.:

```sql
SELECT c.name
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id 
      AND o.status = 'Pending'
);
```

This says: “For each customer, check if at least one pending order exists.”

* You *could* rewrite it with a `JOIN + GROUP BY + HAVING`, but the `EXISTS` version is shorter and often optimized by the database.
* Also, `EXISTS` stops searching after the first match — very efficient in “yes/no” cases.

---

## When non-correlated is **necessary / better**

Example: “Find the top 3 highest order totals.”

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

This has no outer row to reference, so a correlated form doesn’t make sense.
Non-correlated is natural here.

---

## So:

* **If comparing each row to a row-specific calculation → correlated is natural.**
  e.g., “orders higher than that customer’s average.”
* **If comparing groups or precomputed aggregates → non-correlated with GROUP BY is natural.**
  e.g., “products sold in >1 city.”
* **If just checking existence/absence → EXISTS (correlated) is often best.**
* **If doing ranking, top N, or global aggregates → non-correlated is usually the only way.**

---

Think of it like this:

* **Correlated = row by row checking.**
* **Non-correlated = compute once, then reuse.**

Would you like me to make a **side-by-side table of 5 example interview questions** where I show both the correlated and non-correlated versions for the same problem? That might make this crystal clear.
